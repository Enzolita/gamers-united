# Methodology

The Gamers United project follows a methodology inspired by agile principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development
Bugs uncovered during development are documented as GitHub issues, offering insights into each bug's characteristics, impact, and reproduction steps. By hyperlinking these issues in README.md, users can stay updated on bug resolutions and contribute insights.
