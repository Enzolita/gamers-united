# User Stories

### Agile Planning and Development

<br>

At Gamers United, our planning and development process is guided by Agile methodologies and principles. While we don't strictly follow traditional Agile frameworks like scheduled sprints or scrums, we emphasize flexibility, continuous improvement, and swift adaptation to change. Instead of focusing on sprints, we prioritize developing epics that align with backend applications, addressing User Stories based on their priority.

Our overarching strategy divides the project into three key phases: planning, development (which includes unit and functional testing), and continuous deployment. Documentation is created, reviewed, and updated throughout the process. Our approach is straightforward: we develop features in a logical order, prioritizing core functionalities before moving on to more complex aspects.

We actively seek and analyze user feedback to pinpoint areas for improvement, ensuring that our product continuously evolves to meet user needs and expectations effectively.

We used a project [kanban board](https://github.com/users/Enzolita/projects/7) to track progress.

# Methodology

The Gamers United project follows a methodology inspired by agile principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development
Bugs uncovered during development are documented as GitHub issues, offering insights into each bug's characteristics, impact, and reproduction steps. By hyperlinking these issues in README.md, users can stay updated on bug resolutions and contribute insights.

### Iterative Development Approach

 **Configure Settings:**
   - Navigate to "Settings" in new app.

 **Config Vars Setup:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `PORT` as the key and `8000` as its value.

 **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Choose PostgreSQL as database.

        Example "ElephantSQL" was used in this project

 **Configure DATABASE_URL:**

     Note: If using ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL provider, you can use the URL provided by ElephantSQL.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - Create a new file in workspace called `env.py`.
   - Import the `os` library and set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` to the Heroku address (or ElephantSQL URL)
   - Add a secret key using `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - Add the secret key to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `settings.py` of Django app, import `Path` from `pathlib`, `os`, and `dj_database_url`.
   - Add `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env` to the file.
   - Replace the SECRET_KEY with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
   - Replace the database section with `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.

 **Migrate Models:**
   - In workspace terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Cloudinary
To integrate Cloudinary into project, follow these steps:
